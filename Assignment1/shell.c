/*
    Every command given will be counted as a line command
        First string of the command is the name of the program file
        The next strings are counted as arguments
        If the last argument is &, the shell runs in the background
 
 
        1. Creating child process and executing command in the child
            -If the command is a bad command don't store it in the history, warn user
        2. Create a history feature
            -User to access the 10 most recently entered commands starting at 1 and growing
            -If there is no command with an id of whatever, print 'no command found in history'
            -If they choose to enter the command make sure to echo the command on the users screen.
 
        3. Additional commands
            -cd, pwd, exit are all to be done internally
            -fg and jobs as well, need to bring a command from foreground to background
            -output redirection
